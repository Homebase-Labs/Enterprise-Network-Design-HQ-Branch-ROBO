# Homebase-Labs-Address-Table
# Enterprise Network Design Project

## Overview
This project documents the design and implementation of a small-to-medium
enterprise network covering HQ and Branch environments.

The focus is on strong fundamentals:
- Physical and logical topology planning
- Structured IP addressing
- VLAN segmentation
- High availability and scalability
- Clean, manageable enterprise design

## Key Features
- Layer 3 core switching
- VLAN-based segmentation (LAN, Servers, VoIP, Wi-Fi, Guests, APs, Management)
- VRRP for default gateway redundancy
- EtherChannel (LAG) for bandwidth and resilience
- Centralized Wireless LAN Controller
- Dedicated Management VLAN
- Centralized DHCP (Windows Server)

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Routers & Catalyst Switches
- Cisco 2504 Wireless LAN Controller
- VRRP, VLANs, Trunking, EtherChannel
- Windows DHCP Server

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — logical topology and configurations are still being refined.

## Purpose
This is a learning-focused, hands-on project aimed at building
job-ready enterprise networking skills.
